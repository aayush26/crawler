The crawler is intended to work for a single letter by default set to 'a'.
To crawl other letters, manual change is needed.
The entire company directory spans from #-A-B-C.....-Z with over 7 millions+ company urls.

For eg: To crawl letter 'b'
Original: url="https://www.linkedin.com/directory/companies-a-"+str(num)+"/"
Modified: url="https://www.linkedin.com/directory/companies-b-"+str(num)+"/"

To crawl for symbol '#'
url="https://www.linkedin.com/directory/companies-more-"+str(num)+"/"

The output of the program will be text file with company urls.
For each letter, 100 different files will be generated.
